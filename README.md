        <p>ü§ó Hi, I‚Äôm Sabrina.</p>
        <p> I have a passion for learning and expanding my knowledge.</p>
        <p> Completing the <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NE0241/wagon-logo/8174979b99be030e.png" height='25rem' alt="Le Wagon Logo"> <a href='https://lewagon.com' target='_blank'> Le Wagon</a> Bootcamp and the <a href='https://devinhouse.tech/' target='blank'>DevInHouse course at SENAC SC</a> was challenging, but also rewarding experiences. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn new skills such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OOP, DB (SQL), HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
        <p>My next steps‚ùì</p>
        <p>I am currently working on my final bootcamp project, which is a personal budget app. I am refining its features to ensure that it can effectively replace my Excel spreadsheet. This will give me the opportunity to experience the user's perspective and develop a product that provides a realistic user experience.</p>
        <p>I'm already reviewing some concepts through <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/' target='_blank'>The Odin Project</a>, which is an incredible resource for anyone who wants to review some content or even start from scratch.</p>
        <p>I volunteered myself to assist a non-profit organization by helping to improve their platform, which provided me with valuable real-world coding experience.</p>

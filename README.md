        <p>🤗 Hi, I’m Sabrina.</p>
        <p> I have a passion for learning and expanding my knowledge.</p>
        <p> Completing the <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NE0241/wagon-logo/8174979b99be030e.png" height='25rem' alt="Le Wagon Logo"> <a href='https://lewagon.com'> Le Wagon</a> Bootcamp and the <a href='https://devinhouse.tech/'>DevInHouse course at SENAC SC</a> was challenging, but also rewarding experiences. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn new skills such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OOP, DB (SQL), HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
        <p>My next steps❓</p>
        <p>I volunteered myself to assist a non-profit organization by helping to improve their platform, which provided me with valuable real-world coding experience.</p>

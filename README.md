        <p>ü§ó Hi, I‚Äôm Sabrina.</p>
        <p> I have a passion for learning and expanding my knowledge.</p>
        <p> Completing the <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NE0241/wagon-logo/8174979b99be030e.png" height='25rem' alt="Le Wagon Logo"> <a href='https://lewagon.com'> Le Wagon</a> Bootcamp and the <a href='https://devinhouse.tech/'>DevInHouse course at SENAC SC</a> was challenging, but also rewarding experiences. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn new skills such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OOP, DB (SQL), HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
        <p>My next steps‚ùì</p>
        <p> I am taking the highly prestigious <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/">CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a>, a Harvard University online course. This course is designed to teach the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming, covering a wide range of topics such as algorithms, data structures, abstraction, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and web development. It is a challenging course that expouses me to a wide range of programming languages and tools, including C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By completing this course, I am gaining a deep understanding of how to think computationally and creatively, and how to use computers to solve real-world problems. This course is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to take their computer science skills to the next level and become a proficient programmer. It provides me with a rock-solid foundation that will enable me to excel in my future endeavors in the computer science field.

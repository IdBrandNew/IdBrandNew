        <p>ü§ó Hi, I‚Äôm Sabrina.</p>
        <p> I have a passion for learning and expanding my knowledge.</p>
        <p> Completing the <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NE0241/wagon-logo/8174979b99be030e.png" height='25rem' alt="Le Wagon Logo"> <a href='https://lewagon.com'> Le Wagon</a> Bootcamp and the <a href='https://devinhouse.tech/'>DevInHouse course at SENAC SC</a> was challenging, but also rewarding experiences. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn new skills such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OOP, DB (SQL), HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
        <p>My next steps‚ùì</p>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the <a href="https://www.edx.org/cs50">CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a>, an online course offered by Harvard University. This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of computer science and programming, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, abstraction, cryptography, and web development. It is a challenging but rewarding course that exposes me to various languages and tools, such as C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am learning how to think computationally and creatively, and how to solve real-world problems using computers. This course gives me a solid base to continue my journey in learning computer science.</p>
